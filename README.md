# CMU-NHSGA-Projects
This repository includes the projects I've contributed to at Carnegie Mellon University's National High School Game Academy in the summer of 2021. Throughout the 6-week program, I learned a variety of game design skills, ranging from coding in C# to creating audio and art to generating creative and captivating narratives. The most important part of the program, however, was the opinion-coordinating, conflict-resolving, and task-delegating skills I've acquired as a major contributor and leader in these projects.

### Remaking a classic arcade game
During this one-week long project of recreating Marble Madness, I contributed as the team's lead programmer and fabricator. I designed and modeled various 3D shapes to bring to life innovative, original obstacles the marble has to tread through. I also followed the guidance from the level designers to generate 3D tracks and levels in Unity while providing feedback on the design. Through this project, I was exposed to and learned the importance of great leadership.

### Building a brand new game from the ground up
During this one-and-a-half-week long project of creating a brand new game, Search for the Sacred Fish, I contributed as the team's project leader and lead programmer. I organized deadlines, meetings, and tasks for the entire team. I aligned the team's vision and resolved conflicts in opinion, as well as push the project forward in order to meet the shortened deadline. As the lead programmer, I actively developed the intricate and technical workings of the game. To bring the game to the next level, I also learned new tools, such as parallax, post-processing, etc. to bring the finishing touches. Overall, I am very pleased with the outcome of the game, and every single second was worth the effort.

*NOTE: Without the help of my talented, hard-working teammates and my willing, warm-hearted teachers, none of this would be possible.*
